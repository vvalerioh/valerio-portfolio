## Disclaimer and Acknowledgements
Though most of the code in these case studies was written by myself, the analysis and code may have been made better by my colleagues: Gregory Kiker, Olivier Walther, Mark Musumba, Jordan Downey, Nick Stewart and Peter Smittenaar. This website is meant to show my analytical and programming skills, and by no means reflects the position of the University of Florida or Surgo Ventures about these topics, nor do they comprise finished reports and/or products by the author.
