This post is meant to show my analytical and programming skills, and by no means reflects the position of Surgo Ventures about this topic, nor does it comprise a finished report or product by the organization nor the author. 2.2 Purpose I conducted this analysis with open-source data while experiencing a delay in accessing restricted, individual-level data to evaluate the association between county-level Maternal Vulnerability, structural racism measures, and a birthing persons individual-risk of maternal death. The secondary purpose of this analysis was to understand at what levels structural racism may or may not affect maternal health in the US - and the appropriate geographic levels to study it. The findings can help guide future analyses about the topic and inform interventions to reduce maternal health racial disparities in the United States. 2.3 Background The US has one of the highest maternal mortality risks amongst high-income countries, along with some of the highest racial disparities - Black and Native American mothers are 2-4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White mothers. Evidence-based interventions are needed to address this public health crisis. However, this is hampered by surveillance data gaps and standardization issues. It is now well-established that surveillance changes and population health trends - such as the adoption of a pregnancy check box, heart disease, diabetes and increase maternal age - contribute to the increasing maternal mortality ratios (MMR). However, it is likely that neither surveillance changes nor individual-level characteristics fully explain the marked racial disparities in maternal health. The environments in which birthing individuals live, work and give birth in have been found to be associated with pregnancy outcomes (Mujahid et al. 2021). Existing studies tend to consider one or few covariates at a time, and systematic knowledge on how these affect maternal health outcomes is lacking in the US. Specifically, the contribution of each level (individual, neighborhood/community, birth hospital, state) is still unknown. Black and American Indian and Native American (AIAN) mothers are 2.6 and 1.6 more likely to live under Very High maternal vulnerability environments as their White counterparts, suggesting part of the observed racial disparities might be attributable to ecological/environmental characteristics. Another potential driver of these inequities is racism. Though the field is still young and developing, various structural racism metrics, like racial gap in educational attainment (Liu et al. 2019), have been associated with racial disparities in maternal health outcomes. The objectives of this analysis are to: Examine the relationship between maternal vulnerability index (MVI) score and maternal morality in the US. Assess if maternal vulnerability is differently associated with Black and White maternal mortality. Determine if residential segregation, a measure of structural racism, is associated with maternal mortality. 2.4 Methods First, the data will be visualized. Based on the visual inspection of the relationships (see 2.7.1), I will use the following statistical analyses: Linear regression of maternal mortality on state-level maternal vulnerability score. Linear regression of maternal mortality by race on state-level maternal vulnerability score, including an interaction between race and MVI Score. Linear regression of maternal mortality on state-level MVI and residential segregation, if possible. 2.5 Data sources Open-source data were obtained from Surgo Ventures, CDC National Center for Health Statistics, County Health Rankings and the American Community Survey (US Census) Table 2.1: Description of data sources Dataset Source Description US Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) Surgo Ventures (2021) US MVI state-level scores (overall). The US MVI ranks [] states and counties on indicators measuring drivers of poor maternal health outcomes. Maternal vulnerability is assessed based on 43 drivers grouped into six themes: (1) Reproductive Healthcare, (2) Physical Health, (3) Mental Health and Substance Abuse, (4) General Healthcare, (5) Socioeconomic Determinants, and (6) Physical Environment. The MVI captures factors that put birthing people at increased risk of adverse outcomes during pregnancy that may lead to morbidities and/or death. (Valerio et al. 2021) Natality data CDC Wonder (2020) National Vital Statistics data including all births that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, to mothers between 10 and 44 years of age by state and race. Mortality data* CDC Wonder(2020) National Vital Statistics data including all deaths that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, of mothers between 15 and 44 years of age by state and race. Following Hoyert (2019), deaths were included if the underlying cause of death corresponded to ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes A34, O00-O95, and O98-O99. Only births and deaths to and of mothers under 45 years of age were included, following the CDC recommendations - which are based on NCHS assessment of errors.

Visualize the distribution of residential segregation scores: Determine if MVI, MMR and residential segregation are correlated (unweighted) before statistical modeling: There is a strong correlation (0.65) between MVI and state-MMR, but they are not colinear In general, states with high MMR are not necessarily highly segregated States with high maternal vulnerability are not necessarily highly segregated Even though the MVI is built without explicitly weighting its themes, sub-themes and indicators, its multi-dimensional nature might be capturing many factors that make an environment more or less safe for birthing people (hence the high correlation) 2.7.2 Statistical modeling Examine the relationship between maternal vulnerability and maternal morality in the US Findings: MVI is significantly associated with state-level MMR, in both (1) population-weighted and (2) unweighted analyses. The small sample might be a concern when modeling this relationship, however there are over 30 observations and just one covariate in these first model fits, so the sample size is appropriate. There are no strong concerns about violating linear model assumptions. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = mmr_state ~ mvi_mc, data = mmr.state) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -9.8014 -2.7784 -0.2653 2.8935 11.6276 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

As the MVI increases, the risk of death increases for both Black and White mothers: Though the MVI*race/ethnicity interaction was not found to be significant, the data (see 2.1 ) suggests that the MVI might increase the risk of death for Black mothers differently than for White mothers. This would correspond with the findings of our individual-level analysis. However, when talking strictly about this state-level analysis, the technically correct finding is that at the state level, there is not significant difference in how vulnerability increases the risk of death for Black mothers vs White mothers. This is presumably due a small sample size and lack of more information on the birtging individuals (pre-existing conditions, age, etc.) The Black-White mortality gap is not a problem of certain areas or states in the US. Weighting further amplified the effect of race on mortality, suggesting the biggest MMR gaps exist in larger states such as CA, TX, NY. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = mmr ~ mvi_mc + race_ethn + mvi_mc * race_ethn, data = mmr.state.race.ethn %&gt;% ## filter(n_suppressed_rows == 0)) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -18.419 -3.809 -0.279 2.930 34.721 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Due to suppression of maternal deaths, only 30 states were available, which affects the power of the statistical analyses as a minimum of 10 observations per covariate should be included in the sample (rule of thumb).

At the state level, White mothers were found to be at a significantly decreased risk of death than Black mothers. Residential segregation is significantly associated with maternal mortality at the state level, but the effect is much weaker than the findings of the individual-level analysis (carried out using restricted vital statistics data, not shown). This might be due to the state-scale not being appropriate to study racial inequities, to suppression in the data, or to the lack of individual-level characteristics to control for. In regards to analyzing this relationship at the state-level, coarse detail structural racism proxies might mask intra-state variability in racial inequities. For example, though the overall residential segregation level of New Jersey is High (61/100), the within-state variability is also very high (variance = 59) (see 2.2 ). Thus, the state-level may not be appropriate to study the relationship between structural racism and maternal (mortality) health with this proxy. Figure 2.2: State VS county-level Black/White residential segregation 2.8.1 Limitations Methods: Other methods might be more appropriate to study the relationship between maternal vulnerability, structural racism and maternal mortality by race (e.g. multi-level models, ). In this case, I was limited by the quantity and geographic aggregation of data available. Data years available: Though the risk of maternal mortality is high in the US, it is still a rare event. Multiple years had to be combined to source the data for this analysis, but only 2007-2019 were available in both natality and mortality files. Notable surveillance changes have happened during those years. Individual-level characteristics: There are no individual-level characteristics to control for in the data. Residential segregation: state-level measures of structural racism mask intra-state variability in racial inequities. Disaggregation by race and ethnicity: Due to suppression of maternal deaths, only ~30 states could be included in the regression.
