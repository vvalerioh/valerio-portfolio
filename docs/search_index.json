Valerio 2021-11-07 Chapter 1 ABout this site This website contains short analytical examples from Valerie’s portfolio. These examples might include code and analyses carried out as a PhD student at the University of Florida, as a Research Scientist at Surgo Ventures, and/or as side (aka passion) projects. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out (valerievalerioh@gmail.com). To see more of my work, please visit the Resources Chapter (# 6). 1.1 Notes This website includes text, figures and R code chunks. Most figures are generated with R code Code chunks will appear as follows: # This is a comment in an R code chunk # Comments help my colleagues (and Valerie from the future) understand what the code is supposed to do and why ## Install packages ----- install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) "],

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 2.3. 2.2 Objective 2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Data sources table1 &lt;- data.frame( Dataset = c(&#39;US Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI)&#39;, &#39;Natality data&#39;, &#39;Mortality data*&#39;), Source = c(&#39;Surgo Ventures (2021)&#39;, &#39;CDC Wonder (2020)&#39;, &#39;CDC Wonder(2020)&#39;), Description = c(&#39;US MVI state-level scores (overall)&#39;, &#39;National Vital Statistics data including all births that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, to mothers between 10 and 44 years of age by state and race&#39;, &#39;National Vital Statistics data including all deaths that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, of mothers between 15 and 44 years of age by state and race.&#39;) ) knitr::kable( x = table1, caption = &#39;Data sources used in this analysis&#39;, booktabls = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Data sources used in this analysis Dataset Source Description US Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) Surgo Ventures (2021) US MVI state-level scores (overall) Natality data CDC Wonder (2020) National Vital Statistics data including all births that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, to mothers between 10 and 44 years of age by state and race Mortality data* CDC Wonder(2020) National Vital Statistics data including all deaths that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, of mothers between 15 and 44 years of age by state and race. Following Hoyert (2019), deaths were included if the underlying cause of death corresponded to ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes A34, O00-O95, and O98-O99 2.3.2 Data pre-processing 2.3.2.1 Race and ethnicity 2.3.2.2 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) The Maternal Mortality Ratio was calculated as: \\(MMR = (deaths/births)* 100000 &amp; births\\) 2.3.2.3 Visualization The dataset used in this analysis contains the 2.3.2.4 Analysis par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1.
