Evidence-based interventions are needed to address this public health crisis. A systematic understanding of why maternal mortality ratios are so high in the United States is lacking, partly due to surveillance data gaps and standardization issues. It is now well-established that death certificate changes - like adoption of the pregnancy check box - have contributed to the ‘increasing’ trend of maternal mortality in the US. In addition, individual-level characteristics like heart disease, diabetes and increasing age at pregnancy also contribute to the observed maternal mortality rate (MMR). However, neither surveillance changes nor individual-level characteristics can explain the marked racial disparities in maternal health. Multiple studies have found that characteristics of the environments in which birthing individuals live, work and give birth in are associated with pregnancy outcomes. These studies tend to consider on one covariate at a time (e.g. rate of obgyns per 100k population, abortion supportive policies, educational attainment), and systematic knowledge on how these affect maternal health outcomes is lacking in the US. To address this, Surgo Ventures created the US Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI), a multi-dimensional index that ranks US counties and states on a score from 0-100, where 0 and 100 are assigned to the geographies that are the most and least conducive to good maternal health, respectively. Another potential driver of these inequities is racism. Though the field is still young, various racism metrics (like educational attainment disparities) have been found to be associated with disparities in maternal health outcomes. Using the MVI, Surgo Ventures found that Black and American Indian and Native American (AIAN) mothers are 2.6 and 1.6 more likely to live under ‘High Maternal Vulnerability’ as their White counterparts, suggesting part of the observed racial disparities can be attributed to ecological/environmental characteristics. However, it remains unclear if there is an interaction between maternal vulneability and race. In other words: does maternal vulnerability affect mothers from different races differently? The objective of this analysis are to: Examine the relationship between maternal vulnerability and maternal morality at the state level across the U.S. Assess if maternal vulnerability affects maternal mortality differently for Black and White birthing individuals. 2.2 Methods First, the data will be visualized. Based on the visual inspection of the relationships, I will use the following statistical analyses: Linear regression of maternal mortality on state-level Maternal Vulnerability (MV) Score. Linear regression of maternal mortality by race on state-level MVS, including an interaction between race and MV Score 2.3 Data sources Open-source data were obtained from Surgo Ventures and the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. Table 2.1: Data sources used in this analysis Dataset Source Description US Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) Surgo Ventures (2021) US MVI state-level scores (overall). The US MVI “…ranks […] states and counties on indicators measuring drivers of poor maternal health outcomes. Maternal vulnerability is assessed based on 43 drivers grouped into six themes: (1) Reproductive Healthcare, (2) Physical Health, (3) Mental Health and Substance Abuse, (4) General Healthcare, (5) Socioeconomic Determinants, and (6) Physical Environment. The MVI captures factors that put birthing people at increased risk of adverse outcomes during pregnancy that may lead to morbidities and/or death.” (Valerio et al. 2021) Natality data CDC Wonder (2020) National Vital Statistics data including all births that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, to mothers between 10 and 44 years of age by state and race Mortality data* CDC Wonder(2020) National Vital Statistics data including all deaths that occurred in the US between 2007 and 2019, of mothers between 15 and 44 years of age by state and race. *See Data pre-processing (subsection ’2.4) for details 2.4 Data pre-processing The MVI and data dictionary are downloaded from a Zenodo repository and need no pre-processing (see preview below). # Download MVI data ---- # Set urls url1 &lt;- &#39;https://zenodo.org/record/5590225/files/mvi_state.csv?download=1&#39; url2 &lt;- &#39;https://zenodo.org/record/5590225/files/mvi_data_dictionary.xlsx?download=1&#39; # Download data mvi.state &lt;- read.csv(url1) # Use rio library because file extension is .xlsx data.dict &lt;- rio::import(url2) # Preview data head(mvi.state) ## state_GEOID State mvi Th1 Th2 Th3 Th4 Th5 Th6 ## 1 2 Alaska 54 12 38 38 86 32 92 ## 2 1 Alabama 100 60 96 98 100 88 98 ## 3 5 Arkansas 96 96 94 74 65 94 88 ## 4 4 Arizona 70 94 44 68 53 90 54 ## 5 6 California 34 20 42 4 12 54 82 ## 6 8 Colorado 0 20 2 10 35 10 20 # Data dictionary head(data.dict) ## Theme ## 1 SubTheme ## 2 Indicator ## 3 Indicator Description ## 4 Population ## 5 Geo Precision ## 6 Data Source ## Maternal Vulnerability theme name ## 1 Maternal Vulnerability Subtheme name ## 2 Indicator name ## 3 Description of the indicator included in the Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) ## 4 Denominator population for each indicator ## 5 Geographic aggregation levels of data obtained for each indicator ## 6 Data source(s) for each indicator CDC’s natality and mortality data are downloaded from CDC Wonder.

Only births and deaths to and of mothers under 45 years of age were included, following the CDC’s recommendations - which are based on NCHS assessment of errors. 2.4.3.1 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) The Maternal Mortality Ratio was calculated as: \\(MMR = (deaths/births)* 100,000 births\\) 2.4.3.2 Analysis par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!
